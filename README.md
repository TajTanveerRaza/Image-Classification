# Image-Classification

Created three different classifiers that decide the correct orientation of a given image. 

The raw images are treated as numerical feature vectors on which we can apply standard machine learning techniques. In particular, an n X m X 3 color image is taken and all the rows are appended together to produce a single vector of size 1 X 3mn.
